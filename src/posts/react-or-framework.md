This is a commonly asked question in interviews and development circles: **Is React a library or a framework?**

### ✅ React is a **Library**

React focuses on rendering UI components. It does not prescribe how you handle routing, global state, data fetching, or project structure. This flexibility is why it's considered a library.

You typically pair React with tools like:

- **React Router** for routing
- **Redux/Zustand** for state management
- **Axios/React Query** for API calls

### ✅ Next.js is a **Framework**

Next.js, on the other hand, builds on React and adds structure. It includes:

- Routing system
- Server-side rendering (SSR)
- Static site generation (SSG)
- API routes
- Built-in support for performance and SEO

Because it provides most of the tooling and architecture out-of-the-box, **Next.js is a framework**.
