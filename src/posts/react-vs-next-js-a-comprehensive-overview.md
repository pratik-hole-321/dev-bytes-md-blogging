When it comes to ease and meeting project objectives, it is critical for developers to choose the correct framework or library. There are various fantastic Front-end frameworks available. However, when it comes to popularity and usage, React has been on top for nearly a decade. Although, in recent years, another Framework has emerged as a popular alternative to React, and that Framework is none other than NextJS. Well, in this article on **Next JS vs React JS**, we will discuss the tech in-depth.

Both React and Next.js are two of the most popular front-end web development tools nowadays. They‚Äôre enjoyable to work with and are responsible for defining our online experience as the standard tools used to create user interfaces (UI) all over the world. But the question is, which one should you pick?

Basically, when it comes to frameworks, developers tend to favor those that **provide scalability** as well as convenience. Because they do not always have the time to master new software libraries from the ground up. As a result, addressing a platform where the developer‚Äôs experience is comparable helps shorten the learning curve. Aside from that, there are several important criteria that are frequently evaluated, such as performance, learning curve, community support, and so on.

In this article, we will go over all of the important points as well as a full comparison of Next JS vs React JS. In addition, while writing this blog, I analyzed the developer experience of Next.js vs. React.

Before diving deep into the comparison, we will first start with some basic information about React and NextJS. After that, we will dig deep into the specifics.

### What Is ReactJS?

Established by [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/), ReactJS is one of the most popular front-end libraries. Furthermore, it is easily extensible and offers amazing features like routing as well as state management patterns using libraries such as Redux. Besides, it has a small footprint but can be suitable for any project.

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a great solution that includes many important features such as routing and state management patterns. It is a huge, feature-rich library that can be used to develop complex applications. It is well-suited to large-scale projects.

Another characteristic that distinguishes React from other front-end technologies is JSX, which is a syntax and JavaScript extension. There is no need to create a new file for the template and then another file logic with JSX. Simply put, JSX enables a programmer to compose HTML in JavaScript.

You can check out the [official React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) for more information on React in brief.

**Features:**

- JSX
- Components
- One-way Data Binding
- Virtual DOM
- Simplicity
- Performance

Due to such advantageous features, React is highly popular amongst developers as well as tech giants like [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), [Trello](https://trello.com/), [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), etc.

**Advantages:**

One of the primary advantages of utilizing React JS is the ability to reuse components. It saves developers time because they don‚Äôt have to write many programs for the same functionalities. Furthermore, any modifications made to a specific portion of the application will not affect other parts of the application.

Apart from this, the following are some of the advantages that make ReactJS preferable over the frameworks.

- It simplifies JavaScript coding.
- Extremely capable
- Excellent cross-platform compatibility
- Takes care of dependents
- Designing templates has never been easier
- Provides fantastic developer tools
- UI-centric designs
- Simple to modify

When it comes to delivering the best performance, ReactJS is one of the best libraries for building web apps.

## What Is NextJS?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) was built on top of React in order to create a simple development framework. It was created by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) (previously Zeit) and incorporates many of React‚Äôs popular features. Next.js has pre-rendering, routing, code splitting, and Webpack compatibility out of the box.

In other words, NextJS allows you to work swiftly and easily with ReactJS. Furthermore, it has a large number of effective components and features. It seeks to make React application development simpler and more effective. Automatic code splitting, hot module reloading, and routing are examples of these. Next.js manage the React tooling and settings, as well as additional structure, functionality, and optimizations for your project.

With NextJS, Developers only need to create the page and include a link to the component in the header, resulting in less code, greater readability, and better project management. This specialty separates it from React JS.

It can be perfectly combined with headless CMSs, or eCommerce platforms to drive extraordinary performance and SEO results. Apart from this, several companies, including [Starbucks](https://www.starbucks.com/), [Nike](https://www.nike.com/), [Uber](https://www.uber.com/), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/), are using it. Next.js gained prominence in the React community due to its ease of use and ability to create universal JavaScript applications.

Visit the [official Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) for more information.

**Features:**

- Data Fetching
- Built-in CSS
- Adaptability and responsiveness
- Image Optimization
- TypeScript
- Fast Refresh
- Meta Tags
- Routing

**Advantages:**

- Increase your conversion and sales
- Boost your marketing channels
- Outperform your competition online
- Serve clients with a much better user experience
- Cut the maintenance costs
- Scale your business easier
- Speed optimization
- SEO Ready

So, this was the brief of both ReactJS and NextJS. Now, we will break down the difference between ReactJS and NextJS. Although, it is necessary that you know what exactly triggered the popularity of NextJS.
