## Introduction

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript developed and maintained by Microsoft. It adds optional static typing, classes, interfaces, and other powerful features to JavaScript, making it ideal for large-scale applications. TypeScript code is transpiled to plain JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with any browser or JavaScript engine.

---

## Why Use TypeScript?

- **Static Typing**: Helps catch errors early during development.
- **Improved IDE Support**: Provides better IntelliSense, autocompletion, and documentation in editors.
- **Scalability**: Makes managing large codebases easier with interfaces, classes, and strong typing.
- **Future-Proof**: Includes features from newer ECMAScript versions even before they are widely adopted.
- **Readability and Maintainability**: Explicit types make code more readable and maintainable.

---

## Setting Up TypeScript

To get started with TypeScript, you need to install it using npm:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

Create a TypeScript configuration file:

```bash
tsc --init
```

This generates a `tsconfig.json` file with various compiler options.

Compile your TypeScript file:

```bash
tsc filename.ts
```

---

## Basic Types

Here are some of the commonly used types in TypeScript:

```ts
let id: number = 5;
let company: string = "OpenAI";
let isPublished: boolean = true;
let x: any = "Hello";

let ids: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let arr: any[] = [1, true, "Hello"];
```

---

## Tuples

Tuples allow you to express an array with a fixed number of elements and known types:

```ts
let person: [number, string, boolean] = [1, "Pratik", true];
```

---

## Enums

Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants:

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up = 1,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}

console.log(Direction.Up); // 1
```

---

## Objects and Type Aliases

```ts
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
};

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Pratik",
};
```

---

## Type Assertions

Sometimes you may know more about a value than TypeScript does:

```ts
let cid: any = 1;
let customerId = <number>cid;
// or
let customerId2 = cid as number;
```

---

## Functions

You can specify parameter and return types:

```ts
function addNum(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}
```

Use `void` for functions that donâ€™t return anything:

```ts
function log(message: string): void {
  console.log(message);
}
```

---

## Interfaces

Interfaces define the shape of an object:

```ts
interface UserInterface {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age?: number; // optional
}

const user1: UserInterface = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Pratik",
};
```

Interfaces can also describe function types:

```ts
interface MathFunc {
  (x: number, y: number): number;
}

const add: MathFunc = (x, y) => x + y;
```

---

## Classes

TypeScript supports object-oriented programming with classes:

```ts
class Person {
  id: number;
  name: string;

  constructor(id: number, name: string) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }

  register(): string {
    return `${this.name} is now registered`;
  }
}

const brad = new Person(1, "Brad");
console.log(brad.register());
```

---

## Inheritance

```ts
class Employee extends Person {
  position: string;

  constructor(id: number, name: string, position: string) {
    super(id, name);
    this.position = position;
  }
}

const emp = new Employee(2, "Shawn", "Developer");
console.log(emp.register());
```

---

## Generics

Generics allow you to write reusable and flexible code:

```ts
function getArray<T>(items: T[]): T[] {
  return new Array().concat(items);
}

let numArray = getArray<number>([1, 2, 3]);
let strArray = getArray<string>(["a", "b", "c"]);
```

---

## TypeScript vs JavaScript

| Feature         | JavaScript | TypeScript |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Type Safety     | No         | Yes        |
| Compilation     | Not needed | Required   |
| Tooling Support | Basic      | Excellent  |
| ESNext Features | Limited    | Extensive  |

---

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Large-scale Applications**: Teams working on large projects benefit from type safety and interfaces.
2. **Frontend Frameworks**: Angular uses TypeScript by default.
3. **Backend Development**: Works well with Node.js, NestJS, etc.
4. **Tooling & Libraries**: Improves DX (developer experience) when writing reusable libraries.

---

## Best Practices

- Always use `tsconfig.json` for consistent configuration.
- Avoid using `any`; prefer specific types.
- Use interfaces for object shapes.
- Break code into reusable components and modules.
- Use type-safe third-party libraries.

---

## Conclusion

TypeScript enhances JavaScript development by introducing type safety, object-oriented principles, and robust tooling support. Whether you're working solo or in a team, adopting TypeScript can lead to fewer bugs, better documentation, and scalable applications.

Keep practicing and exploring TypeScript's rich ecosystem!
